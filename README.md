Tasks Performed :

Identify Relevant Features
          The Project begins with  loading the flight dataset using the Pandas library and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA involves understanding the dataset's structure, identifying key variables, and visualizing patterns to gain insights into the data.Following EDA, relevant features for modeling will be selected. This step involves choosing variables that have significant impacts on the target variable based on the insights gained during exploratory analysis.
Data Cleansing and Preprocessing
             Data cleansing and preprocessing are essential steps to ensure data quality. This involves handling missing values, duplicates, and performing necessary transformations to prepare the dataset for modeling.
 Feature Engineering
             Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones based on domain knowledge or insights obtained during EDA. This step enhances the dataset by introducing additional relevant information.
Feature Selection
          Feature selection aims to choose the most impactful features for modeling. Techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance, or domain expertise are employed to identify and retain the most relevant variables.
Model Development and Evaluation
 Train a Regression Model
              The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, and various regression models, such as Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regressor, are trained. Model evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared are used to assess model performance.
Model Tuning and Improvement
             Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV is performed to optimize model performance. Outlier handling and checks for model robustness are crucial steps in this task.
